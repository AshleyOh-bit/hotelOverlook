# Overlook Hotel

## Abstract

This project was written as a final project for the completion of Mod 2 of Turing School of Software and Design. The learning goals included: creating a class structure, implementing a full testing suite to test said classes, using sass to improve CSS styling, and working with APIs to send and receive data. It was also a learning goal to ask for code reviews from our mentors and peers. 

The Overlook Hotel's website allows you to login with the following credentials: username: customer50; password: overlook2021. This login brings you to your dashboard, Eldridge Muller, where you can see your past bookings, future bookings, and total spent to date. The site allows you to book a room and view those bookings as cards in your dashboard.
